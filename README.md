# To handle forms easily in react , make use of Formik library


# TO make netflix logo overlap on the background , use absolute class in tailwind
# bg-gradient-to-b from-black : Makes shadow like colour to the element to-b means at bottom of the element , to-t means at top of the element
# Z-index : In CSS, "z-index" is a property that controls the stacking order of overlapping elements on a webpage, meaning it determines which element appears on top of another when they overlap; an element with a higher z-index value will be displayed in front of elements with lower z-index values.
# To center the element : my-24 mx-auto right-0 left-0
# To make background transparent : bg-opacity-80
